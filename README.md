# amethyst
amethyst is a website that lets you stream your desktop to it, so you can play games and other stuff from anything with a web browser
amethyst allows streaming from any iframe, so you can simply open a local file with an iframe in it and you can use your computer on it.


# amethyst is in OPEN BETA
The HTML source code can be found by opening the site in DevTools or ripping it with https://saveweb2zip.com
The backend source might be public, but that would be in the very future

# please, PLEASE, never expect this to be used commonly.
amethyst is in very early beta. its performance will not be great, but there is still quite low latency.

none of your data is shared to anyone nor myself, it runs through the agent that you host yourself

most of the frontend is chatgpt, i was too lazy to write it myself
